# Contribute to TimerX

TimerX is written in **Python**, so you have to install it if you want to contribute.
You can download  the latest version [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3101/).
Make sure to check `Add python 3.10 to path` when installing it.

When you installed python, you have to get the current source code. You can either do this with [git](https://git-scm.com/)
by executing the following command in a directory of your choice:
```
git clone https://github.com/sumeshir26/TimerX
```
or press the green `Code` button on the [repository](https://www.github.com/sumeshir26/Timer) and then clicking `Download Zip`

Then open a terminal in the directory of the source code and execute the following commands:
```
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 -m pip install -r windows-requirements.txt
```

Now you can just open a text editor of your choice and start coding!

If you are done with the code. You can [fork the repository](https://github.com/sumeshir26/TimerX) and create a new branch.
Commit your changes to that new branch, [open a pull request](https://github.com/sumeshir26/TimerX/pulls) and someone will review it asap.
